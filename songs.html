      <h1>Song Covers</h1>
      <p class="sub">I don’t have the voice to sing, but making songs is a fun hobby for me anyway. I learned GarageBand and how to make beats, so I’ve been recording simple covers for practice.</p>

      <!-- Track 1 -->

          <div class="track-title">Girl, so confusing featuring nick (Charli xcx Cover)</div>
          <p class="track-desc">This song is so iconic and autotuned, I had to recreate it! I went all in on matching the sharp production and layered vocals. Honestly, I think my version holds up against the original (and maybe even edges it out). It was such a fun one to experiment with.</p>

        <figcaption>
          <div class="track-title">logical (Olivia Rodrigo Cover)</div>
          <p class="track-desc">This one was a bit more complicated. I used the piano skills I learned back in fifth grade to build the instrumental from scratch, layering it with soft harmonies and a minimal beat I made in GarageBand.</p>

      <!-- Track 3 -->

        <figcaption>
          <div class="track-title">Take It Off (Kesha Cover)</div>
          <p class="track-desc">Total throwback. Recording this taught me a ton about energy control and keeping that sound while still staying on beat. I focused on layering, breath control, and learning how to use compression.</p>

        <figcaption>
          <div class="track-title">You're the Reason (Victorious Cover)</div>
          <p class="track-desc">A nostalgic one. When I was 11 years old, I gifted a cover of this song to my sister for her birthday so I obviously had to recreate it. This time around, I definitely learned a lot about mixing and balancing softer parts.</p>
